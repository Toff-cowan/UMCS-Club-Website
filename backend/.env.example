# this is a sample environment file for the backend server configuration.
# so you will need to create a .env file on your local machines and also ensure that the same variables are set in your deployment environment.
# please do not commit your actual .env file to version control as it may contain sensitive information.
# this is just an example file to illustrate the required environment variables.

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/yourDBname
NODE_ENV=development

# create you .env file in your backend folder and then the url you copy from mongo you paste after MONGO_URI=

#then add your database name at the end of the url.

#to see the data you do npm run seed in the backend folder to seed the database with mock data
#that is how you can test the api routes, and get the data to show on the frontend.

#Note this is just an example file to illustrate the required environment variables.
#Make sure to replace 'yourDBname' with the actual name of your database.
# and note that the variables are within the routes folder and models in the backend.
