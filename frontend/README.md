# Structure Breakdown 

In the /src folder, you see assets, components folders and pages

## assets
in assets is where you put your pictures and graphics. 

## components 
this is where you build the navigation layout and structure

- /footer
- /header
- /navbar
- /layout (this creates a format so that the browser renders the above components in a porper structure)

## pages
-this is where the pages are created.

create folders for the pages that contain the .jsx and .module.scss files for each respective page. 

### Notice

- Please document you development of the files and how you came to your final solutions. 

- create branches for the necessary code so that you dont force a errors onto main. 
    - note that branches for pages can be done as pages/[page-name]


#### All the best with development
